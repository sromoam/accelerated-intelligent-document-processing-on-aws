# Key Information Extraction Benchmarks

Extraction fills your database. For each section, it returns the values of the fields you
defined for the section's document class.
[Key Information Extraction](../idp-fundamentals/extraction.md) explains how it works.

## What decides extraction accuracy on your documents

This page measures how configuration choices change extraction accuracy. On your own
documents, two things matter more than any setting.

**1. Your definitions.** The extraction model returns the fields you define, in the structure
you define, and reads each field's description as its instruction. Good definitions:

- **Name the right fields.** Ask for the values your database needs, one value per field.
- **Get the relationships right.** Put values that belong together, such as the date, rate
  and description of a line item, in one list, so each row stays whole.
- **Say clearly what each field is.** Say where the value appears and what it is not: "the
  date the invoice was issued, not the due date".
- **Show what a value looks like.** Give the format you want, such as YYYY-MM-DD, or a number
  without a currency sign. For a hard document class, add a few-shot example.

See [Improving accuracy](../idp-fundamentals/extraction.md#improving-accuracy-once-your-pipeline-is-running).

**2. Your annotations.** Test Studio measures accuracy against the ground truth in your test
set, so a wrong annotation counts as an extraction error. In our experience, annotation
errors usually make up more than half of the errors Test Studio reports. Reliable numbers
need a test set with few annotation errors, and getting there usually takes a few rounds of
review: check each reported error, and fix the annotation when the extraction was right. See
[Measure with ground truth](../idp-fundamentals/index.md#4-measure-with-ground-truth) and
[Draft labeling](../test-studio.md#draft-labeling-unlabeled-documents--ground-truth).

**Data quality** matters too. The extraction model reads the OCR text and the page images.
Poor scans and handwriting give it less to read, and long tables need a mode built for them.

**Settings** are what the benchmarks below measure:

## Questions

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED FAQ -->

### When is agentic (iterative) extraction worth it?

**Answer:** For invoices with more than about 150 to 200 line items. Single pass got almost none of the line items right on the RealKIE invoices with 182 or more items (line-item score 0.00 to 0.50, and 0 on the invoices with 309, 392 and 1,490 items); iterative extraction got 0.32 to 0.90 on the same invoices. Below that size single pass did better and cost less: across all 20 RealKIE invoices its line-item score was 0.61 against 0.45. Iterative extraction did not finish the 1,490-item invoice within Test Studio's time limit. [Details: EX-01](#ex-01-when-is-agentic-iterative-extraction-worth-it)

*Weighted accuracy against cost per 1,000 documents (USD). Each point is one value of the setting; shaded bands span two standard errors either side. Up and to the left is better. Lines run from the cheapest value to each more accurate one, labeled with the marginal cost of error: the extra cost per error prevented ([Marginal Cost of Error](marginal-cost-of-error.md)).* Datasets: [RealKIE](datasets.md#realkie-fcc-verified-20-invoices), [RealKIE, short](datasets.md#realkie-fcc-verified-short-invoices-24-invoices-1-or-2-pages), [RealKIE, long](datasets.md#realkie-fcc-verified-long-invoices-19-invoices-8-to-33-pages), [Fake-W2](datasets.md#fake-w2-tax-forms-w-2-forms-45-fields).

N: RealKIE — 20 documents × 3 runs; RealKIE, short — 24 documents × 3 runs; RealKIE, long — 18–19 documents × 3 runs, 1 failed document per run left out; Fake-W2 — 20 documents × 3 runs. Costs use on-demand prices for us-east-1 from [config_library/pricing.yaml](../../config_library/pricing.yaml) as of 2026-11-13.

### Which extraction model should I use?

**Answer:** On W-2 forms, Claude Opus 5, Claude Opus 5.5, OpenAI GPT-6 Astra and xAI Grok 4.6 were nearly perfect (0.999), 0.04 above the default, Claude Sonnet 5 (0.96), and Claude Haiku 5.5 scored 0.98; the Amazon Nova models scored 0.06 to 0.16 below the default. On RealKIE invoices no model scored measurably different from the default (0.74 to 0.84). Each model family counts tokens differently, so compare models on cost rather than tokens. xAI Grok 4.6 took about three times as long per document.

Costs use on-demand prices for us-east-1 from [config_library/pricing.yaml](../../config_library/pricing.yaml) as of 2026-11-13.

### Does more reasoning effort improve extraction?

**Answer:** A little, for few tokens. High effort raised accuracy from 0.79 to 0.83 on RealKIE invoices and from 0.95 to 0.97 on W-2 forms, for 2 to 5% more total tokens per page and a few seconds per document. Both gains are near the edge of the noise on 20 documents, so confirm on your own test set before you change the default. [Details: EX-03](#ex-03-does-more-reasoning-effort-improve-extraction)

### Does structured output make single-pass extraction more accurate?

**Answer:** Structured output, or leave it off; avoid the forced tool. Structured output scored the same as the default on W-2 forms (0.96) and slightly higher on RealKIE invoices (0.84 against 0.81, at the edge of the noise), and it was a little cheaper and faster. The forced tool lowered accuracy on W-2 forms (0.89 against 0.96) and got no W-2 fully right. [Details: EX-12](#ex-12-does-structured-output-make-single-pass-extraction-more-accurate)

## Metrics on this page

- *List recall:* the share of ground-truth list cells extracted correctly; a lost row
  lowers it.
- *List precision:* the share of extracted list cells that are correct; an invented or
  misaligned row lowers it.
- *Weighted accuracy:* Stickler's field-weighted score against ground truth.
- *Documents with every field right:* the share of documents with no wrong field.

Weighted accuracy counts a whole list as one field, so a lost row barely moves it. Read list recall for lists.

#### EX-02: Which extraction model should I use?

**Answer:** On W-2 forms, Claude Opus 5, Claude Opus 5.5, OpenAI GPT-6 Astra and xAI Grok 4.6 were nearly perfect (0.999), 0.04 above the default, Claude Sonnet 5 (0.96), and Claude Haiku 5.5 scored 0.98; the Amazon Nova models scored 0.06 to 0.16 below the default. On RealKIE invoices no model scored measurably different from the default (0.74 to 0.84). Each model family counts tokens differently, so compare models on cost rather than tokens. xAI Grok 4.6 took about three times as long per document.

#### EX-03: Does more reasoning effort improve extraction?

**Answer:** A little, for few tokens. High effort raised accuracy from 0.79 to 0.83 on RealKIE invoices and from 0.95 to 0.97 on W-2 forms, for 2 to 5% more total tokens per page and a few seconds per document. Both gains are near the edge of the noise on 20 documents, so confirm on your own test set before you change the default.

#### EX-12: Does structured output make single-pass extraction more accurate?

**Answer:** Structured output, or leave it off; avoid the forced tool. Structured output scored the same as the default on W-2 forms (0.96) and slightly higher on RealKIE invoices (0.84 against 0.81, at the edge of the noise), and it was a little cheaper and faster. The forced tool lowered accuracy on W-2 forms (0.89 against 0.96) and got no W-2 fully right.

#### EX-13: How should I extract sections that hold several records?

**Answer:** Not yet measured.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Changes** | Multi-instance sections |
| **Everything else** | As each dataset's [preset](index.md#how-we-run-a-benchmark) sets it |
| **Datasets** | [Synthetic file holding two statements](datasets.md#synthetic-file-holding-two-statements); [Fake-W2-Tax-Forms (W-2 forms, 45 fields)](datasets.md#fake-w2-tax-forms-w-2-forms-45-fields) |
| **Runs** | 3 per document, per value |

| Dataset | Multi-instance sections | Weighted accuracy | Extraction tokens per page |

| Fake-W2 | On | — | — |


#### EX-14: How accurate is extraction across many document formats?

**Answer:** Not yet measured.

#### EX-15: How much do splitting errors cost extraction in a packet?

**Answer:** Not yet measured.

Needs a dataset we haven't built yet: Packets with section and field ground truth (to be built).
