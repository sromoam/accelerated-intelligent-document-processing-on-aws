# Confidence Assessment Benchmarks

Confidence assessment gives every extracted value a score, so a person reviews the values
most likely to be wrong instead of every value.
[Confidence Assessment](../idp-fundamentals/confidence-assessment.md) explains how it works.

## How to improve confidence on your documents

**Your definitions.** The scoring model reads each field's description when it judges a
value. Say what a right value looks like. Mark the fields you can't do without as required:
an empty required field goes to review even though it has no score. See
[Improving confidence](../idp-fundamentals/confidence-assessment.md#improving-confidence-once-your-pipeline-is-running).

**Data quality.** Poor scans cause more extraction mistakes, and catching those mistakes is
the job confidence does. We measure it on [ConfBench](../extensions/confbench-testset.md),
which adds scan noise to real invoices.

**Settings.**

| Setting | What it changes | Questions |
|---|---|---|
| Scoring mode | A separate scoring pass, scores inside the extraction call, or none | [CF-03](#separate-scoring-pass-or-integrated-into-extraction) |
| Scoring model | The model that scores each value | [CF-02](#which-scoring-model-should-i-use) |
| Confidence threshold | The score below which a value goes to review | [CF-01](#can-i-route-human-review-by-confidence), [CF-04](#what-confidence-threshold-should-i-set) |
| Page images | Whether the scoring model sees the pages | [CF-06](#does-the-scoring-model-need-page-images) |
| List batch size | How many list rows the scoring model scores in one request | [CF-07](#how-should-long-lists-be-scored) |

## Questions

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED FAQ -->

### Can I route human review by confidence?

**Answer:** Not yet measured. [Details: CF-01](#cf-01-can-i-route-human-review-by-confidence)

### Which scoring model should I use?

**Answer:** Use Claude Haiku 5.5 or Claude Sonnet 5 when people review by confidence. On RealKIE invoices they separated right values from wrong ones (AUROC 0.81 and 0.83) at about the same scoring tokens per page as the default, Amazon Nova Lite, which scored 0.42: no better than a coin flip. [Details: CF-02](#cf-02-which-scoring-model-should-i-use)

![AUROC against cost per 1,000 documents (USD) for each Scoring model](../../images/benchmark-guidance/CF-02-fields.svg)

*AUROC against cost per 1,000 documents (USD). Each point is one value of the setting; shaded bands span two standard errors either side. Up and to the left is better.* Datasets: [RealKIE](datasets.md#realkie-fcc-verified-20-invoices). Models: OCR: Amazon Textract (Tables, Layout, Signatures) · Classification: Amazon Nova 2 Lite, page by page (no calls billed) · Extraction: Claude Sonnet 5, single pass · Confidence: varies (the setting under test). N = 20 documents × 3 runs. Costs use on-demand prices for us-east-1 from [config_library/pricing.yaml](../../config_library/pricing.yaml) as of 2026-11-13.

### Separate scoring pass or integrated into extraction?

**Answer:** Separate, with a scoring model that works, or off. On W-2 forms integrated scoring separated right from wrong values better than the default separate pass with Amazon Nova Lite (AUROC 0.76 against 0.47) and used 36% fewer tokens per page, but it lowered extraction accuracy from 0.96 to 0.92. Turning confidence off changed no extracted value and cut tokens per page by 55% to 65%. On RealKIE invoices integrated ran as a separate pass, because in single-pass extraction the accelerator scores a class with list fields separately. For confidence you can act on, use a separate pass with Claude Haiku 5.5 or Claude Sonnet 5 (see CF-02). [Details: CF-03](#cf-03-separate-scoring-pass-or-integrated-into-extraction)

![Weighted accuracy against cost per 1,000 documents (USD) for each Confidence mode](../../images/benchmark-guidance/CF-03-fields.svg)

*Weighted accuracy against cost per 1,000 documents (USD). Each point is one value of the setting; shaded bands span two standard errors either side. Up and to the left is better. Lines run from the cheapest value to each other value, labeled with the marginal cost of error: the extra cost per error prevented ([Marginal Cost of Error](marginal-cost-of-error.md)).* Datasets: [RealKIE](datasets.md#realkie-fcc-verified-20-invoices), [Fake-W2](datasets.md#fake-w2-tax-forms-w-2-forms-45-fields).

N = 20 documents × 3 runs. Costs use on-demand prices for us-east-1 from [config_library/pricing.yaml](../../config_library/pricing.yaml) as of 2026-11-13.

### What confidence threshold should I set?

**Answer:** Not yet measured. [Details: CF-04](#cf-04-what-confidence-threshold-should-i-set)

### Does classification confidence flag the wrong document class?

**Answer:** Not yet measured. [Details: CF-05](#cf-05-does-classification-confidence-flag-the-wrong-document-class)

### Does the scoring model need page images?

**Answer:** Not yet measured. [Details: CF-06](#cf-06-does-the-scoring-model-need-page-images)

### How should long lists be scored?

**Answer:** Not yet measured. [Details: CF-07](#cf-07-how-should-long-lists-be-scored)

## Metrics on this page

- *AUROC:* the chance that a wrong value scores lower than a right one. 0.5 is a coin flip.
- *Calibration error:* the gap between the scores and the measured accuracy.
- *Values below threshold:* the share of values the threshold sends to review.
- *Errors below threshold:* the share of wrong values the threshold sends to review.
